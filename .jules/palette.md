## 2024-05-23 - [CLI Menu Mnemonics]
**Learning:** CLI menus with number-only selection are cognitively slower. Adding mnemonic shortcuts (e.g., `[t]oggle` vs `1`) significantly improves navigation speed for power users.
**Action:** When designing CLI menus, always implement and highlight single-key mnemonics (using brackets `[k]ey`) and support them in the `case` statement.
