## 2024-05-24 - Mnemonic Overload Handling
**Learning:** When adding mnemonic shortcuts to a large menu, collisions are inevitable (e.g., 'd' for Disable vs Dashboard). Using intuitive alternatives like 'o' for "Turn [o]ff" or sticking to the verb's second letter is better than obscure keys, provided the label clearly highlights the bracketed key.
**Action:** When key collisions occur, modify the UI label to emphasize the chosen shortcut (e.g., "Turn [o]ff") rather than forcing a non-intuitive key.
